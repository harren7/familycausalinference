##  The Influence of Early Education on Children's Eventual Academic Attainment


Using the [FFCW](https://ffcws.princeton.edu/documentation) dataset, we hope to investigate the causal impact of early childhood education on long-term academic outcomes. Through our analysis we hope to demonstrate that, in addition to a causal link to the treatment, income is a significant multiplier of such an effect.
