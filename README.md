Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study Analysis


*Investigating the impact of parent’s education on early childhood education within poor families, and it’s effect on the future academic achievement of the child*

"To what extent do parental education level, within poorer communities, influence early childhood education participation and subsequent academic achievement among children?”

In impoverished communities, there are often disparities in educational opportunities - and they are primarily influenced by parent’s education and socio-economic status. We want to understand if educated parents provide early education to their children, thereby promoting an academic environment. Could such an environment ultimately lead to a child pursuing an advanced degree such as a Bachelor’s/Master’s? We hypothesize that higher education levels among parent’s positively correlate with increased early childhood education participation and enhanced academic achievement among children from poor families.
